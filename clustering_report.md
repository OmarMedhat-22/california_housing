## Overview
Applying K-Means and DBSCAN to the California Housing dataset produced complementary views of market structure. K-Means distilled the data into three broad segments that roughly separate high-population southern corridors with comparatively higher values, mid-latitude aging markets of moderate value around the Bay/central coast, and inland tracts with larger room counts but generally lower values—showing how location, density, and housing stock age co-vary with price. DBSCAN, which clusters by local density and marks noise, exploded that coarse picture into many localized neighborhoods that align with major metros (Bay Area near −122°, Greater Los Angeles around −118°, Central Valley near −119°, San Diego corridor near −117°, Sacramento/foothills near −121°) and expose micro-patterns: older, dense coastal tracts can command higher median values even with smaller bedroom ratios; newer suburban belts show mixed pricing tied to recent development; and extensive inland/valley clusters pair large populations with markedly lower values. Noise points capture extreme or atypical cases—very high density, unusual bedroom occupancy, or value/income mismatches—flagging records for review or targeted investigation. Across methods, median income remained a strong correlate of housing value, underscoring its predictive power. Together, these results support policy targeting (affordability hot spots), investment screening (undervalued growth pockets), feature engineering for price models, and anomaly detection pipelines that focus analyst attention where patterns break.
